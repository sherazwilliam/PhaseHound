# Roadmap & Suggestions

- Environment override for socket path (e.g., `PH_SOCK_PATH` env var) in CLI and core
- Named feeds discovery endpoint and JSON schema docs
- Optional JSON library for robust parsing while keeping helpers for the hot path
- Versioned plugin capability introspection
- Built‑in SHM ring layout helpers (header + notifications)
- Systemd unit and socket activation
